# Reflection by Falena Rotzell

This lab required me to write a file called `ManipulateDNA'. I thought this was
the hardest lab we have gotten. I was confused from the beginning. Looking at
the book for replacing a letter helped though. I was able to learn from the
book and transfer the knowledge for what we were doing in our lab. I had some
upsets on figuring out how to make it work for the lab.

I had gotten through some steps but then realized I messed up with putting the
scanner. I also did not name the string correctly. This caused me to re-do most
of what I had done. With help from the teaching assistants and my colleagues I
was able to work through each step. I understood what I was doing. It took me a
while to understand what they had said. I know that they had to run through the
process a couple of times until I understood it.

I need to look back over the book and my notes from the lab to get a deeper
understanding of what I had done. It was hard for me to understand what I was
doing at first. Once I knew it became easier. Studying the book and notes will
help me in the future. If I do not study them I think it will make it harder
for me to understand the next labs and practicals. I want to not only do them
correctly but understand what I am doing.
